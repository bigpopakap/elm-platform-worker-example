This is a little experiment to learn how to use Elm's 
`Platform.worker`

- Make sure that Node and Express are installed
- Run `Make -d` in the terminal
- Run `node run/server.js`
- Go to `http://localhost/3000/compute/1`
- Check the terminal

More to do: the server should return the computed result.
